1. main_TSP_with_dynamic_parallelism FILE CONTAINS SAMPLE CODES FROM MY THESIS LOCATION "SPEEDING UP TSP WITH USING CUDA". I WRITE THE CODE IN MANY DIFFERENT METHODS. (TILED, USING SHARED MEMORY, USING GLOBAL MEMORY, etc.). BUT I SHARE WITH YOU THAT I HAVE ONE OF THEM WITH DYNAMIC PARALLELISM. THESE CODES HAVE BEEN TRIED BY WORKING ON ABDULLAH GUL UNIVERSITY'S HPC SYSTEM (WITH BASH).
