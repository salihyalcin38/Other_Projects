1. I used Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS1 Noetic for this project.
2. I created my own simulation environment in Gazebo. (I used Build editor and added some objects in the world. Then saved my assig3.world file)
3. Then, I created my launch and worlds file. And, I started turtlebot3 with my simulation environment. (roslaunch my_package assig3.launch)
4. Finally, I started the simulation with main.py file. Main.py file is in the attachment as well. (./main.py or rosrun my_package main.py)
